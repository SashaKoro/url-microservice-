# URL Shortener Microservice

Project for Free Code Camp. Built using Node, Express and mongodb. Testing done with mocha, expect and supertest.

### User Stories:

1. I can pass a URL as a parameter and I will receive a shortened URL in the JSON response.

2. When I visited the shortened URL, it will redirect to the original URL.

3. If I pass an invalid URL, the JSON response will inform me of my error.
